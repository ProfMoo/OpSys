Quiz 3 handed back.

Homework 3
-- Submitty should be up tomorrow (Tuesday 10/31), so due date will be pushed out accordingly

====================================================================

Inter-process Communication (IPC)
-- synchronization
-- protocol (defining how multiple things will communicate)

Open Systems Interconnection

-- the ISO proposal for the standardization of various protocols in computer networks

--a seven-layer protocol stack:

	CLIENT										SERVER
	-----------									-------------
	Application (e.g., HTTP)  <=============>   Application
	(Presentation)								(Presentation)
	(Session)									(Session)
	Transport (e.g., TCP, UDP)	<===========>	Transport
	Network (e.g., IP)  <===================>	Network
	(Data Link)									(Data Link)
	Physical (e.g., Ethernet)  <============>	Physical

-- as you go down the stack, you keep adding headers. then, before sending over
physical, you add a checksum.

=======================================================================================

TCP vs. UDP

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
-- connection-oriented (establishes connection before doing anything else)
	-- uses a threeway handshake to set-up connection (says it wants 
		to connect, gets approval, says it has connected)
-- reliable protocol (re-sent missing packets if necesary)
	-- made possible by headers
-- overhead (like the large headers/sequence numbers)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
-- connectionless
-- unreliable protocol (no re-sending of dropped datagrams)
-- low overhead

IP

Internet Protocol (IP)
-- IP provides host-to-host delivery service of datagrams
-- IP is connectionless
-- IP is unreliable (no re-sending of dropped datagrams)

IP addresses
-- IP addresses are logical addresses at the Network Layer

An IP address contains information about what NETWORK the destination host is on,
	which enables ROUTING at the intermediate hops at the Network Layer.
	-- This encoding is embdedded within each IP address

	128.113.0.2 (www.rpi.edu)
	128.113.126.24 (www.cs.rpi.edu)
	164.67.228.152 (www.ucle.edu)

IPC requirements:
-- synchronization
-- protocol --application-level protocol
-- data marshalling (primarily for networking communication)

	04/01/2010	==> April 1st, 2010
				==> January 4th, 2010

	-- this is data marshalling. making sure we have the same interpretation
	-- or we could send this with a key so there is no confusion. ex:

	YYYY-MM-DD (2010-04-01)

	big endian vs. little endian
	C: htons() is the host-to-network-short translation function
	   htonl() is the host-to-network-long translation function
	   ntohs() is the network-to-host-short translation function
	   ntohl() is the network-to-host-long translation function

===================================================================================

Sockets-based communication
-- a SOCKET is an endpoint for communication
-- sockets-based communication can be connection-oriented or connectionless
-- a SERVER will create one or more sockets that it will then LISTEN on for
	incoming client connection requests or incoming datagrams/packets
	-- the server listens on one or more specific PORT numbers (2-byte short)
	-- well-known port numbers include:
	
	21 FTP
	22 SSH
	23 TELNET
	25 SMTP
	80 HTTP
	443 HTTPS
